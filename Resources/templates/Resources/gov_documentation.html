            1. Kids from the age of 3 to 6 will start learning early to help them grow smarter and happier.
            <br>
            2. In school, students will have a different way of learning. It will be more about understanding things and not just memorizing facts.
            <br>
            3. There will be fewer big exams that stress students out. Instead, there will be different ways to see how well they are doing.
            <br>
            4. Teachers will get better training, so they can teach students well.
            <br>
            5. We will use computers and the internet more to help students learn, especially in places far away.
            <br>
            6. Students will learn in their own language and also learn other languages.
            <br>
            7. There will be new rules to make sure everyone, no matter how rich or poor, gets a good education.
            <br>
            8. We will encourage students to be more creative and think for themselves.
            <br>
            9. More money will be spent on research and new ideas in education.
            <br>

          <!-- Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) -->
          <div class="related-div mgnrega">The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) is a vital Indian social welfare program enacted in 2005. Its core objective is to provide rural households with a right to work, guaranteeing at least 100 days of wage employment per financial year. MNREGA primarily focuses on unskilled labor, offering employment in public works projects like road construction and water conservation.
            <br>
            The program places a strong emphasis on women's participation, ensuring that at least one-third of beneficiaries are women. Funding is shared between the central and state governments, with the central government covering wage payments and the state government handling other expenses. MNREGA promotes transparency and accountability through social audits.
            <br>
            Households in rural areas register for MNREGA work at local Gram Panchayats, and eligible households receive job cards that serve as an entitlement to demand work. To enhance efficiency and reduce leakages, the program has adopted the Electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS) for direct wage payments.
            <br>
            MNREGA has made a significant impact on rural employment, poverty reduction, and social development, serving as a vital safety net for vulnerable households. Nonetheless, challenges such as delayed wage payments and issues related to the quality of assets created remain areas for improvement.</div>

            <br>
            6. <b>Financial Incentives</b>: Successful candidates receive financial incentives upon completion of their training. These incentives help cover the cost of training and other related expenses.
            <br>
            7. <b>Quality Assurance</b>: Quality is a significant focus, with monitoring and assessment of training centers to ensure that the training provided is of high quality and meets industry standards.

            The scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and is continuously evolving to meet the changing demands of the job market. It has played a significant role in enhancing the employability of the Indian workforce, fostering entrepreneurship, and supporting the country's vision of a skilled and self-reliant workforce.
